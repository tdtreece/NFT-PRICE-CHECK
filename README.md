# NFT-PRICE-CHECK
Discord bot used to check NFT prices with the OpenSea.io API

The main NFT_Price_Check.py file is what will run the actual bot. You need to replace the last line where it says 'token' with your specific Discord bot token that you have created.

You will create the NFTs you want to check the price of as NFT objects in the NFT_Class.py file. An example is at the bottom of this file already using the Cryptopunkis NFT collection.

You can change the bot command prefix with line 5 of the NFT_Price_Check.py file. The command by default will be "$nft_buys".
